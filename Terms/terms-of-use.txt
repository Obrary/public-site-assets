<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE ("AGREEMENT" OR "TERMS OF USE") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE WEBSITE AND SERVICES OFFERED BY OBRARY, INC. (REFERRED TO AS, "OBRARY"). THIS AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AT OBRARY.COM (THE "SITE") AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY OBRARY (COLLECTIVELY, THE “SERVICES”).</p>

<p>By using the Services in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you (the "user" or "you") agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink. This Agreement applies to all users of the Services, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants, contributors of content, information and other materials or services on the Site.

<h2>1. Obrary is a Venue</h2>
<p>Obrary acts as a venue to allow users who comply with Obrary's policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods within a fixed-price format. Obrary is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, Obrary has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. Obrary does not pre-screen users (except for services that require an application) or the content or information provided by users. Obrary cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.

<p>Consequently, Obrary does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.

<p>Obrary cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. Obrary encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.

<p>You agree that Obrary is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on Obrary. You use the Obrary service at your own risk.

<h2>2. Membership Eligibility</h2>
<p>Age: Obrary's services are available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and older who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. Obrary may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer access to or use of the Services to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.

<p>Individuals under the age of 18 must at all times use Obrary's services only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age. In all cases, the adult is the user and is responsible for any and all activities.

<p>Compliance: You agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content. You are responsible for all applicable taxes. In addition, you must abide by Obrary's policies as stated in the Agreement and the Obrary policy documents listed below (if applicable to your activities on or use of the Services) as well as all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Site by Obrary, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and each of which may be updated by Obrary from time to time without notice to you:
<ul>
<li>Fees and Billing Policy</li>
<li>Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, some services offered by Obrary may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Obrary from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.

<p>Password: Keep your password secure. You are fully responsible for all activity, liability and damage resulting from your failure to maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify Obrary of any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security. You also agree that Obrary cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your password secure. You agree not to provide your username and password information in combination to any other party other than Obrary without Obrary's express written permission.

<p>Account Information: You must keep your account information up-to-date and accurate at all times, including a valid email address. To sell items on Obrary you must provide and maintain valid payment information such as valid credit card information or a valid PayPal account.

<p>Account Transfer: You may not transfer or sell your Obrary account and User ID to another party. You are responsible for all activity of the account and User ID. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement.

<p>Right to Refuse Service: Obrary reserves the right, in Obrary's sole discretion, to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts. Obrary reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason, at any time.

<h2>3. Fees and Billing</h2>
<p>Joining and creating an account with Obrary is free. Obrary charges a setup fee for each product page created, as well as a percentage of the sale price when the item sells. When you list an item, you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Obrary's Fees Policy, which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for Obrary's services are effective after Obrary provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Site. Obrary may, at Obrary's sole discretion, change some or all of Obrary's services at any time. In the event Obrary introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD).

<p>In certain situations, including but not limited to a void or invalid transaction, Obrary may issue a credit for the applicable fees to a seller's billing statement.

<p>You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using Obrary. Obrary will send an invoice to the seller’s email address on file detailing the amount due for the prior month’s fees and charges. The seller must pay the amount due in full within 15 days of the date of the invoice, or the account will be considered past due.

<p>Fees and Termination: If Obrary terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Obrary fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Obrary for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Obrary.

<h2>4. Listing and Selling</h2>
<p>Listing Description: All listings on Obrary must be for sale. By listing an item on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Obrary's published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your Obrary shop. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing.

<p>Shop Policies: All sellers are urged to outline shop policies for their Obrary shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment and selling policies. Sellers must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All shop policies must comply with Obrary's site-wide policies. Sellers are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable shop policies. Obrary reserves the right to request that a seller modify a shop policy.

<p>Binding Sale: Sellers are responsible for accurately listing their items, and buyers are responsible for reading the description of items before making a purchase. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.

<p>Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Obrary transaction fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without permission.

<h2>5. Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Items and Activities</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct and activities on and regarding to Obrary and any and all data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links (together, "Content") that you submit, post, and display on Obrary.
