## ﻿o·brar·y \'oh-brer-ee:
*noun*:  The library of Open Design products

###Background

Obrary is a marketplace of products collaboratively designed by the community. These products can be designed or produced by anyone, amateur or professional manufacturer, wherever economically or reasonably practical.

###Inspiration
We are inspired by the change that Open Source has brought about.  From software applications like Apache  and Git, operating systems like Linux and innovative hardware like RepRap and Rasberry Pi.  Our mission is to accomplish similar feats of positive change around how tangible real-world products are designed and manufactured, making that process more open and accessible for any who want to participate. 

In Open Source, the source designs and code are made available to anyone for anyone to *use* or **improve**. Here’s the definition from Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software, 

 “Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose”

We see the same benefits for the world of products. Open access to the source files of designs and the ability to improve or customize those designs will enable the community to accelerate the test/learn/iterate cycle and explore new uses for products.

Beyond improved sharing of design resources, new design approaches and software engineering patterns  enable.

We are an independent company and are here to harness and direct the co-creation of new and interesting products designed for digital fabrication.

###Open Design

We host and publish designs that adhere to the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0).  You can learn more about this license [here](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) These are free culture compatible licenses, meaning that they do not impose limited uses.  Learn more about creative commons licensing here.  We do not view BY-SA-NC to be an equal otherwise compatible with open design principles as it favors commercial restriction over innovation and freedom. 


If you use designs from Obrary:

- **You must provide attribution.** You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- **You inherit ShareAlike Creative Commons rules** — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
- **No additional restrictions** — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.”
- **You *can* use the design for Commercial Use** — This license allows for commercial use.
- **You may have access to the designer(s)** — Whenever possible, we will provide communication access to the source designer so that new designers or makers can ask questions about the design.

If you submit Open Designs to Obrary:

- You must agree to the communal rights to share, study, change and distribute of your source design.
- **You must provide source files**. The design source file is from the CAD application used to create the design. This could be Sketch-Up, Grasshopper, InkScape, etc. We believe that in order for others to iterate on the design, they are most empowered by the source file versus an exchange formats like DXF and STL.
- You will receive improvements, augmentations and adaptations to your original design. 

####Why Creative Commons?

Creative Commons has easy to understand licenses. Some other licenses have long documents full of legalize that aren’t user friendly. Creative Commons is the now the most popular licenses for hardware and designs, so our hope is that CC will be more easily identified and understood by people. The Creative Commons license is about general IP and is not just for software or technology based hardware.

###Team
We are a team of technologists, business leaders, product designers, and seasoned entrepreneurs -- all makers. We eat our dog food of making, building, and collaborating, not because we have to, or because it’s research, but because it’s so fun.
