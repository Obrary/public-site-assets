#Democratizing Product Design

Obrary is a community for open design, a marketplace of products collaboratively designed by the community. We want to harness and enable Crowd Collaboration - when people get together to create something new or improve on something that already exists. Open access to the source files of designs and the ability to improve or customize those designs will  accelerate the test/learn/iterate cycle and explore new uses for products. 

#We strive to ...
- Empower makers to collaborate on the design and digital  fabrication of products
- Change the design paradigm to incorporate how the product is manufactured inside the design
- Empower designers and makers to create designs that are flexible to make custom products cost-competitive
- Facilitate a crowdsourced collection of open designs that anyone can improve or iterate on
- Enable consumers to get customized products that meet their exact needs
