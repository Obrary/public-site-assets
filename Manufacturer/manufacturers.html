<h2>Easy to Implement</h2>

In any web-based product configurator implementation, defining your product rules is the single most important activity. It can also be the most time-consuming. From the start, over 15 years ago, Configure One’s vision was to develop a web-based product configurator that was easy-to-use and easy-to-implement. That’s why Configure One’s web configurator and CPQ software gives you such an edge.

easy-to-use, point and click administrative screens allow customers to implement the software and define product rules quickly and without programming knowledge
powerful setup screens allow for the efficient capture of rules for assemble-to-order, configure-to-order, and engineer-to-order product lines
administrative and setup screens are completely web-based, giving you the flexibility to let your users implement and maintain the web configurator from anywhere in the world
compiling is not needed to activate rules, this unique feature allows customers to implement their configurator more rapidly
Concept Publisher module allows for easy publishing of changes between development, test and production environments
the web configurator software handles even the most complex rules for option compatibility, bills of material generation, part numbering creation, pricing, discounting, document creation, manufacturing routings generation, dynamically created drawings, visualization and more
there’s no limit on the number of rules you can capture


<h2>Easy operation</h2>



<h2>Mutilingual & Multinational User Interface</h2>
Today’s international customers expect to conduct business in their native language and local currency. That’s why Configure One’s web configurator software provides you with industry-leading multilingual and multinational (currency, user-level time zone preference, numeric entry preference, etc.) web product configurator functionality.

The Concept Multilingual module allows customers to present the web configurator software screens in their users’ local language. The multilingual functionality also provides the ability to produce documents such as proposals in different languages. So if a user wants to use Concept in Spanish, but produce a proposal in German for their end customers, that’s no problem.

Compared to other web configurators, Concept does an excellent job of supporting both single- and double-byte (Mandarin, Japanese, etc.) character sets. These days, even small and medium sized companies are doing business globally and require this multilingual web product configurator functionality.
