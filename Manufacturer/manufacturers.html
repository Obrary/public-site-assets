Concept Publisher module allows for easy publishing of changes between development, test and production environments
the web configurator software handles even the most complex rules for option compatibility, bills of material generation, part numbering creation, pricing, discounting, document creation, manufacturing routings generation, dynamically created drawings, visualization and more
