		<h2>Easy to Implement</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-8">
					<p>In any web-based product configurator implementation, defining your product rules is the single most important activity. It can also be the most time-consuming. From the start, over 15 years ago, Configure One’s vision was to develop a web-based product configurator that was easy-to-use and easy-to-implement. That’s why Configure One’s web configurator and CPQ software gives you such an edge.</p>
					<br>&bull; easy-to-use, point and click administrative screens allow customers to implement the software and define product rules quickly and without programming knowledge
					<br>&bull; powerful setup screens allow for the efficient capture of rules for assemble-to-order, configure-to-order, and engineer-to-order product lines
					<br>&bull; administrative and setup screens are completely web-based, giving you the flexibility to let your users implement and maintain the web configurator from anywhere in the world
					<br>&bull; compiling is not needed to activate rules, this unique feature allows customers to implement their configurator more rapidly
					<br>&bull; Concept Publisher module allows for easy publishing of changes between development, test and production environments
					<br>&bull; the web configurator software handles even the most complex rules for option compatibility, bills of material generation, part numbering creation, pricing, discounting, document creation, manufacturing routings generation, dynamically created drawings, visualization and more
					<br>&bull; there’s no limit on the number of rules you can capture
